## [Flash Feed](http://mhacks.challengepost.com/submissions/17431-flash-feed)
### By Brad Dwyer [@braddwyer](https://twitter.com/braddwyer)

Flash Feed lets you ask your Page's fans questions and receive responses via
a post's comments. The backend listens to the realtime updates stream from
Facebook and replies to comments programmatically based on their content.

It also uses the "Feed Gaming" api in a creative way to display poll results as
a post attachment. This enables users to interact with the brand without having
to give up personal information or go through an OAuth flow. This integration
was inspired by Ribbon's

tabbr is a search engine for tabs. Navigating to a tab slows down with more
tabs. Instead, tabbr jumps directly to the tab you want by searching for it.
A ranking algorithm will select the tab you want based on many factors, such as
keywords in the tab content, tab title, tab url, frequency of accesses, most
recently used, and other factors.

Exchanging contacts can be a pain at any networking event. By crowd sourcing
contact information, we make getting someone's number as easy as typing their
name into a search box. We use twilio to accept "contact requests" even for
those who don't have the app. We built the back end off Parse for a scalable
solution that will take us beyond our first 3 thousand contacts to millions
around the nation.

Our iPhone App is a suite of services that use the I/O devices of the phone in
unique ways. It features a "Friction Finder": a service that uses the
accelerometer to find the coefficient of friction between the phone and another
surface by sliding the phone along it. It also has a "Record Player" that uses
the phone's gyroscope; you can play music at variable speed by spinning your
phone about the z-axis.

A trashcan that sorts items into recyclables and non-recyclables based on the
sound that the item makes as it enters the trashcan.

This prototype uses the sound that a material makes when it hits a platform to
determine what the material is, and based on that information, determines
whether or not the item is recyclable.

A glove that could be used as an input to control a virtual reality software on
the computer. The glove gives a feedback to the hand to make an illusion of
holding an object by slightly restricting the movements of fingers pulling them
with a servo mounted on the glove.
